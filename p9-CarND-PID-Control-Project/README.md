# Udacity PID Controller Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

* In this project, I have used PID controller to maneuver the vehicle around the track. The simulator will provide the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle. 


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Maneuver the vehicle around the track.
* I have used two PID contollers with one controlling the Steering Value and other for Speed.
* The hyper parameters have been set to both the contollers.
* Cross Track Error(CTE) and Speed error are calculated with the respective formula..
* With two PID controllers, I was able to Maneuver the vehicle without going off the track. Twiddle was not needed for this project.


I have used starter code provided from the Udacity for completion of the project.

1. Setup the project.
2. Update the PID.cpp for calulations and main.cpp to invoke PID, to calulate the Cross Track Error, Speed Error, Steering Value and Throttle.
3. Run the simuator to capture the simulator Video.
