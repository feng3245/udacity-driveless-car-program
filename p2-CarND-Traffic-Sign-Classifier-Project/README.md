## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

Here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/manjunathc/udacity-driveless-car-program/blob/master/p2-CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/Traffic_Sign_Classifier-final.ipynb)

###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.
I downloaded the dataset from below link [Traffic Data Set](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). 
The dataset contained 
* Training set
* Test Set
* Validation Set

I used the pickle library to load the data set

* The size of training set is 34799 with 34799 Labels
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a Histo chart showing how the data before Normalization. The chart depicts the Unique classes and the number of images assocaited with each unique Label.

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to process the images without normalization and plot the images for all classess. For simplicity I decided to display only first 10 images per class. I was visually able to see many of the images were unclear with blurring. 

I used OpenCV Normalization function to normalization every image in the dataset. 

Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after Normalization.

Before Normalization

After Normalization

I haven't used to generate additional data as the testset was ~30% of the original imageset. The validation set was ~13%.

####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 3x3     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x12 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x6 				|
| Convolution 3x3	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x16  |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16 				|
| Flatten	      	| Flatten. Input = 5x5x16. Output = 400. 				|
| Fully connected		| Input = 400. Output = 120.  |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropouts					|												|
| Fully connected		| Input = 120. Output = 84.  |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropouts					|												|
| Fully connected		| Input = 84. Output = 43.  |
| Softmax				|        									|


####3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

I used 20 Epochs and batch size of 128 with AdamOptimizer. Other Hyperparameter with learning rate of 0.001. 

####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. 

Initalally I trained the network without adding the dropouts and Max Pooling with the same Epoch, Optimizer and batch Size. The accuracy was less than 85%.
Later I decided to add the Max Pooling and Dropouts. The accuracy remained around 89% with the validation set. I increased the Epochs to 150. That helped the validation accuracy around 93%.
Later, I added normalization to the images which improved the accuracy and efficiency. With just 20 epochs I was able to see an improvement of validation accuracy more than 93%. 
With more epcohs the accuracy could be improved much better.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of ? 99.6 % 
* validation set accuracy of ? 95.4 % 
* test set accuracy of ? 93.5 %

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
LeNet-5 is the latest convolutional network designed for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition. I started with Lenet's architecture with  Convolution 3x3. The output was 5, 5, 3, 6. without Image normalization, Max Pooling or Dropouts. 
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
The validation and testing data accuracy was less than 85-90% even though the training accuracy was around 90%. I had to train for the longer duration with many iterations (Epochs > 150). It was time consuming and not accurate.

* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? 
I added additional layer with output of 5, 5, 3, 12 with the initial Layer. Additional to that I aaded Max pooling along with dropout at multiple layer using an activation function. This was used to reduce overfitting of the data and to improve the accuracy. Apart from that I did normalization of entire training set to improve the efficiency of training data.


* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
Initially I started adding Dropouts followed by Max Pooling. I added Training dataset Normalization to improve overall efficiency.


* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? 
Adding the Max Pooling and Dropout helps in overfitting with AdamOptimizer.

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
Lenet's architecture was chosen based on the Latest avaialble architecture for Character recognition.
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
All Traffic data contains symbols. Lenet's model works well with Symbols
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?

The accuracy of the training, validation proved with 20 iterations that the model works well with Traffic Images.  

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image15] ![alt text][image16] ![alt text][image17]



####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Speed limit (20km/h)      		| Speed limit (20km/h)   									| 
| No entry     			| No entry 										|
| Go straight or right					| Go straight or right											|
| Go straight or left	      		| Go straight or left					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 100%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of 94.2

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 1.00         		| Speed limit (20km/h)   									| 
| 1.00     				| No entry 										|
| 1.00					  | Go straight or right											|
| 1.00      			| Go straight or left					 				|
| 1.00				    | Slippery Road      							|
