**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior

####3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model uses [NVidia](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) Architecture with modifications. 

Below is the details of NVidia architecture.

####2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 10-16). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

####3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 132).

####4. Appropriate training data

I used the simualator [dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584f6edd_data/data.zip) provided by Udacity for training the network.

I used the simualator [dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584f6edd_data/data.zip) provided by Udacity for training the network.

The Simuator dataset consists of images and a CSV file. Total of 24108 images with size of each image (160,320,3) captured from the 3 cameras mounted on center, left and right of the car. The dataset also contains a CSV file which has metadata about the images.

The metadata consists of Image paths, Steering angle, throttle, break and speed data at various interwals during the training.

The data can be used to directly train the network. However, the data needs augmentation for various scneraios such as sharp turns, shadows, tress etc. 

I used the python CSV functions to read the training data from CSV. I didn't clean up the data and used only resizing. Initially I used CV2 image read function. However, I had difficulties using the simulator. Later I used the approach as suggested in the [link](https://medium.com/@yazeedalrubyli/behavioral-cloning-tiny-mistake-cost-me-15-days-23dd13a3b525)


###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. Solution Design Approach

I started with fit_generator. It was too slow and took hours to train. Rather I used the tradditional approach to store the data in memory which was much faster and more easy to test.

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the Nivida. I chose the model based as a starting point. However, the model is comlicated and I had to reduce the complexity. I removed the additional layers, Max Pooling and Dropouts.
Even without Max Pooling and Dropouts the network errors were reducing both for training set and Validation set.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I need to add more augmentation data, with Image transformation and Cleanups.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

####2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 109-133) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes.


| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 66x200x3 RGB image   							| 
| Normalization         		| 							| 
| Normalization         		| 	((20,0), (0,0))						| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 2x2 stride, valid padding 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 2x2 stride, valid padding 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 2x2 stride, valid padding 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Convolution 3x3	    | 2x2 stride, valid padding  |
| RELU					|												|
| Flatten	      	| Flatten. Output = 100. 				|
| Fully connected		| Input = 100. Output = 50.  |
| RELU					|												|
| Fully connected		| Input = 50. Output = 10.  |
| RELU					|												|
| Dropouts					|												|
| Fully connected		| Input = 10. Output = 1.  |

####3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

I used the sample data from Udacity. After resizing below is sample image.

![alt text][image2]

To augment the data set, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would improve the driving of the car. One condition while flipping is to add the correction factor of 0.2.



I did try shuffling the data. However, there was no improvisation of driving and was adversly affected.
