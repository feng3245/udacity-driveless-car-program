The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Maneuver the vehicle around the track.
* Calculate the Cost Funtion, Optmial Trajectory, Steering angle (δ) and acceleration/throttle (a) using - 
	* JSON data with Map-Coordinates, Vehicle Model which consists of State and Control Inputs.
	* State inputs are [x,y,ψ,v,cte,eψ] and Control Inputs(Actuators)


* I have used MPC to optimize the Control Inputs, simulate tracjectory and minimize the errors. (Cross Track Error and Orientation error).
* Kinematic Model is used for its simplicity. However, it doesn't take into account the external forces such as gravity, tire forces, Mass.
* I have used starter code provided from the Udacity for completion of the project. 

## Implementation
### Rubric Point - The Model : 

**Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.**

* In this project, I have implemented Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track. 
* Kinematic Vehicle Model with Actuator constraints are the foundation of model predictive controls. 
* This defines the future trajectory of the vehicle. 
* In order to develop an optimal controller, we need define the cost function that reduces the errors (Cross track error and Orientation error)

The vehicle model consists of:
#### State 

* x: Vehicle x position
* y: Vehicle y position
* ψ (psi): vehicle’s angle in radians from the x-direction (radians)
* ν: vehicle’s velocity
* cte: cross track error - Error between the center of the road and the vehicle's position as the cross track error
* eψ : orientation error 

#### Control/Accuator Inputs 

* δ: Steering Angle 
* a: Accelerator/Brakes

Below are state, actuators and update equations.

	* Define the duration of trajectory T by choosing N and dt.
	* Define the vehicle Model
	* Define Constraints with Actuator Limitations
	* Find Cost Function

### Rubric Point - Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt) : 

**Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.**

* Prediction horizon : 

T = N * dt
	* T = Duration over which future predictions are made
	* N = N is the number of timesteps in the horizon
	* dt = dt is how much time elapses between actuations

* Number of Timesteps -  N
	* Model Predictive Control is to optimize the control inputs: [δ,a]. An optimizer will tune these inputs until a low cost vector of control inputs is found. The length of this vector is determined by N.

A good approach to setting N, dt, and T is to first determine a reasonable range for T and then tune dt and N appropriately, keeping the effect of each in mind. 

The value of N and dt are below.

* N = 7
* dt = 0.1 // I tested with 0.3, 0.8,

T = 7 * 0.1 = .7Secs

The future predictiosn are done over 0.7 secs.

### Rubric Point

**Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried** 
  
I started with N = 20 and dt = 0.05 which was 1 sec. I thought it was a good parameter for prediction. Even though the car was with the track, it was swaying across the path especially during the tracjectory motion.

So, I modified both N, dt with Various values. There are videos for N=7 and dt = 0.3 and 0.8. 

Finally, N=7 with dt = 0.1 and Latency with 150 ms worked various speeds of 50, 75 and 100 MPH. 

**Once I chose N and dt, I held it constant and tuned all cost funtions.**

The tuning of cost funtions played a major role in achieveing the final result. I increased the Orientation error by multiplicative factor(5) and a higher penalty factor (1250) was added to the steering angle for a stable control behavior at higher velocities. I even tuned the latency to 150 ms to account for the processing time of the solver and the latency of the communication with the simulator. 

This did help to reduce the Oscillations.

Final Values and weights Used: 

	* N = 7;  //Line number 18 in MPC.cpp
	* dt = 0.1;  //Line number 19 in MPC.cpp 
	* reference_cte = 0.0; //Line number 21 in MPC.cpp 
	* reference_epsi = 0.0; //Line number 22 in MPC.cpp 
	* reference_v = 50.0; //Line number 23 in MPC.cpp 
	* Weight for reference_epsi = 10 //Line number 87 in MPC.cpp
	* Weight for throttle/acceleration = 50 //Line number 95 in MPC.cpp  
	* Weight for Orientation error = 5 //Line number 101 in MPC.cpp 
	* Weight for Steering angle = 1250 //Line number 100 in MPC.cpp 
	* Latency = 150 ms //Line number 27 in main.cpp

### Rubric Point - Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing : 

**A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.**

* The JSON data consists of the map co-ordinates (waypoints). However, we need Vehicle co-ordinates for MPC algorithm. The conversion was done in the main.cpp (Lines 124 - 130)
* Following formulas were used for conversion.
	* dx = X-Coordinate of the map - x-Coordinate of the vehicle;
    * dy = Y-Coordinate of the map - y-Coordinate of the vehicle;
    * x_vehicle_coordinates = dx * cos(-psi) - dy * sin(-psi);
    * y_vehicle_coordinates = dy * cos(-psi) + dx * sin(-psi);
* Third Order polynomial is calculated to the given x and y coordinates representing vehicle-coordinates. Main.cpp (Line 133)


### Rubric Point - Model Predictive Control with Latency : 

**The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.**

* In a real car, an actuation command won't execute instantly - there will be a delay as the command propagates through the system.
* A realistic delay might be on the order of 100 milliseconds. A latency of 150ms was added to increase stability.
* The delay was added to the Kinematic Model and passed to MPC routine. The code for this is found in main.cpp (Lines 137 - 143)

## Simulation
### Rubric Point - The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track. : 

**No tire may leave the drivable portion of the track surface. The car may not pop up onto ledges or roll over any surfaces that would otherwise be considered unsafe (if humans were in the vehicle).
The car can't go over the curb, but, driving on the lines before the curb is ok.**
