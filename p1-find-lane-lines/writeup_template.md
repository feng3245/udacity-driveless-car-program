**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 

My first step was to create a function to could read an image and convert into an transformed image. The whole transformation contained following process.

###1. Convert input image into Grayscale. This removes the entire color so we can focus only on the white and black areas. 
###2. Use Compter Vision Libraries(cv2 libraries) create a Guasian Blur. The guasian blur mechanism is used to reduce the image noise.
###3. After the Guausian blur image is created, the next step is create a canny edge image which outlines the edges in an image.
###4. The canny detected image
