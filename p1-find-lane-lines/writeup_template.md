**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 

My first step was to create a function to could read an image and convert into an transformed image. The whole transformation contained following process.

* Convert input image into Grayscale. This removes the entire color so we can focus only on the white and black areas. 
* Use Compter Vision Libraries(cv2 libraries) create a Guasian Blur. The guasian blur mechanism is used to reduce the image noise.
* After the Guausian blur image is created, the next step is create a canny edge image which outlines the edges in an image. The canny image creates a outline of the entire image.
* Next step is to create a Lane Lines by color and masking all the areas. This is done by calling region_of_interest function which converts the input Guausian blurred image to a masked image (both color as well as regions).
* Masked image is converted from line space to hough space. A line in image space will be a single point at the position (m, b) in Hough space.

###3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
